# spare-parts
This is a very basic project is a binary file named “auto” which is used to store  the values of the car name, the spare part as well as the cost  which is useful for a mechanic. It features inserting, reading,  searching, updating and deleting records from the file using  built-in as well as user defined functions in the format of a  menu driven program
This project is also useful for those in the who are in the learning phase of binary files or file handling in general. The project gets input from the customer and used to save the data, show the data, update the existing data or delete a specific row if it is over. 

Modules used in this code are:
os module: used for interacting with operating system.
pickle module: used for binary file operations.
So we imported os and pickle modules.
